# Framework-GPU-to-MXM
A project to make the first MXM module for the Framework 16.
*Info*
The Framework 16's Expansion bay can't support the size of an MXM module by default, (at least not a type-B module which is bigger than a type a module), but it *can* support it if the back of the GPU expansion slot is pulled out further

*Disclaimer*
I am not the legal owner of the datasheet describing the footprint of an MXM connector. It is in this repository strictly as a helpful reference for anyone who might desire to use or cross reference it. I will of course remove it at the request of the author.
